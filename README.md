# dynamic-memory-allocation-output

C calloc() method “calloc” or “contiguous allocation” method in C is used to dynamically allocate the specified number of blocks of memory of the specified type. it is very much similar to malloc() but has two different points and these are: 1.It initializes each block with a default value ‘0’. 2.It has two parameters or arguments as compare to malloc().

Syntax: ptr = (cast-type*)calloc(n, element-size);
